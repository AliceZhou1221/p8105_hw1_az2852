# Question 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins (344 rows × 8 columns) dataset contains flipper, bill, and
body mass data for Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins recorded in
2007-2009 from Torgersen Island, Biscoe Island, and Dream Island. Each
row is data for one penguin, including species, island, bill length,
flipper length, and body mass. The average flipper length for the
penguins in the dataset is 200.92 mm.

Below is a plot of flipper length agains bill length for the penguins in
the dataset (342 penguins and 2 missing values). The plot is divided
into three clusters when colored by species. Penguins of the same
species tend to have similar bill length and flipper length. For
example, Adelies in general have the shortest flippers and bills;
Chinstraps have the longest flippers; Gentoos have the longest bills.
The clusters are well defined but there is some spread within each
cluster, showing considerable individual difference within the penguin
population. It also appears that there might be a positive correlation
between bill length and flipper length.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(
  x = bill_length_mm,
  y = flipper_length_mm, 
  color = species)) + 
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Flipper Length (mm)", 
       y = "Bill Length (mm)" 
)
```

# Question 2

Here we will explore variable types in R. First, we create a data frame
comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  gtzero = samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("this", "vector", "will", "be", "of", "length", "10", "isn't", "it", "?"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Small", "Medium", "Large", "Small", "Medium", "Large", "Small", "Medium", "Large", "Medium")),
)
```

You can take the mean of numeric variables.

``` r
mean(pull(df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.02406851

You may also take the mean of logical variables (TRUE is considered as 1
and FALSE is considered as 0).

``` r
mean(pull(df, gtzero))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

But you cannot take the mean of character variables.

``` r
mean(pull(df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

You cannot take the mean of factor variables.

``` r
mean(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Now, we apply the `as.numeric` function to logical, character, and
factor variables:

- Converting logicals into numeric will give you 1s and 0s. This happens
  because TRUE and FALSE are treated as binary values (1 and 0) in
  numeric context.
- Converting characters into numeric will return NAs and a warning. It
  seems like you cannot convert character strings into numeric values
  directly unless the character strings represent numbers.
- Converting factors into numeric will show their underlying levels
  (3,2,1 corresponding to “Small”, “Medium”, “Large”).

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_factor))
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(df, gtzero))
```
