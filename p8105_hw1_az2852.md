# Question 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins (344 rows Ã— 8 columns) dataset contains flipper, bill, and
body mass data for Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins recorded in
2007-2009 from Torgersen Island, Biscoe Island, and Dream Island. Each
row is data for one penguin, including bill length, bill width, and
flipper length in centimeters, and body mass in grams. The average
flipper length for the penguins in the dataset is
`mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)`

Below is a plot of flipper length agains bill length for the penguins in
the dataset (342 penguins and 2 missing values). Penguins of the same
species tend to have similar bill length and flipper length. The data is
clearly clustered by species with just a few overlapping points. It
appears that the Adelies have the shortest flippers and bills. The
Chinstraps have the longest flippers. The Gentoos have the longest
bills. It also appears that penguins with longer flippers tend to have a
longer bill.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(
  x = bill_length_mm,
  y = flipper_length_mm, 
  color = species)) + 
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Flipper Length (mm)", 
       y = "Bill Length (mm)" 
)
```

Below is a plot of temperature against time of the day (midnight to
midnight). As we might expect, the temperature tends to reach a minimum
in the early morning, increase during the day, and begin to drop off in
the evening. The temperatures have a fairly narrow spread consistent
with what we might expect in January, with a few particularly warm or
cold days that we can clearly follow. It would also appear that higher
temperatures might be associated with higher humidities.
